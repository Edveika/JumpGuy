# 🚧 NOT finished

This is one of my bigger projects, and it is not finished. I want to take a break from game development, and I will finish it later.

# 🏗️ ToDo

* Fix collision detection - under certain condition the player might go through the wall(use collision detection Framework?)
* DX9 sprites/images causes fps drops, replace with a different api or find out what the issue is
* Refactor - some functions are way too large, encapsulation is not very good
* When space is pressed, the character sometimes wont jump

# 👑 JumpGuy

Jump Guy is a remake of the Jump King game. It features 43 levels from the original game. Can you reach the top?
